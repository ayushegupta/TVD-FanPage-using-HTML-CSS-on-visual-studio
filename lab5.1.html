    <p style="color:#FFD700;">Elena and Bonnie were originally best friends, while Caroline was closer to Bonnie, mainly due to being jealous of Elena. After Caroline's transformation into a vampire, her friendship with Bonnie deteriorated for a short time, but Elena was there for her, strengthening their friendship. Bonnie later accepted Caroline the way she was, and they quickly rekindled their close friendship.</p>
